    <p>Bellow shows a snippet of code from my Field Session project this summer</p>
    <pre>
    <code style="color: darkred; font-family:courier">
        convertDateToNum(now) {
        var start = new Date(now.getFullYear(), 0, 0);
        var diff = (now - start) + ((start.getTimezoneOffset() - now.getTimezoneOffset()) * 60 * 1000);
        var oneDay = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
        var day = Math.round(diff / oneDay);
        console.log('Day of year: ' + day);
        return day;
