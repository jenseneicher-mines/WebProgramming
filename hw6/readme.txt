    I decided to pursue a quiz that has multiple questions per category. This made the javascript substantially
    more complicated. I stored each set of questions and answers in an array and used indexing based on the length of those arrays.
    This allows the quiz to be easily added to with more questions by simply appending to the arrays. I also
    decided to create a results page and a play again button that will reset the quiz and allow you to play again.
    I hope that the extra complexity met the requirements! Thanks!
