Questions:

1. What styling is used to make the links display horizontally (i.e., on larger screens)
2. What part of the code (in the HTML file) actually causes the hamburger icon to appear? Be specific.
3. How does this code use CSS pseudo-classes to display only home and the hamburger when the screen size is small?
